# Various notes - 20 September 2023

## Action items:
- contact Filip about the thresholds setup for the software trigger - why not R=0.2 - Florian - email to Fillip / CC to others
- skimming data formats (output of the software trigger) - understand the structure, footprint and location of the files, copy some to hiccup - Raymond
  - [Docs on skimming](https://aliceo2group.github.io/analysis-framework/docs/basics-usage/SavingTablesToFile.html?highlight=skim) . We can pick out fields immediately, although if we want to aclculate more (which we usually will), we need explicit tasks
- further skimming to track tables - Raymond - Florian - add photon events - HF? checkin with Preeti?
    - HF meeting yesterday - find in INDICO - looking for people for HF-jets / service task; HF-jet framework within JE-framework
- scaling of analysis using python within O2; further skimming - Raymond

## General goals:
- primary target for pp is to find out if we can do 2023 pp locally - all of it ?
- which software triggers RNC group wants/requests?
  - find out if the JE strategy is OK
  - photon software triggers
  - HF software triggers - higher a thresholds data sets?
