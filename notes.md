# Various notes - 20 September 2023

## Action items:
- contact Filip about the thresholds setup for the software trigger - why not R=0.2 - Florian - email to Fillip / CC to others
- skimming data formats (output of the software trigger) - understand the structure, footprint and location of the files, copy some to hiccup - Raymond
  - [Docs on skimming](https://aliceo2group.github.io/analysis-framework/docs/basics-usage/SavingTablesToFile.html?highlight=skim) . We can pick out fields immediately, although if we want to aclculate more (which we usually will), we need explicit tasks
- further skimming to track tables - Raymond - Florian - add photon events - HF? checkin with Preeti?
    - HF meeting yesterday - find in INDICO - looking for people for HF-jets / service task; HF-jet framework within JE-framework
- scaling of analysis using python within O2; further skimming - Raymond

## General goals:
- primary target for pp is to find out if we can do 2023 pp locally - all of it ?
- which software triggers RNC group wants/requests?
  - find out if the JE strategy is OK
  - photon software triggers
  - HF software triggers - higher a thresholds data sets?

# 27 Septemeber 2023

New JE o2 dev meeting [indico here](https://indico.cern.ch/category/16173/) . Meeting time is bad for us.

Action items:
- re-engage in organization of the meetings within JE - better timing for us - potentially 7AM Wednesdays
    - understand what is OUR best time/day - we should make sure at least one of us connects
    - potential for two meetings? - not ideal
    - share your best times with the group / MP
- check the service task assignement for QA
    - validation of JE framework - comparison to Run 2
    - underlying event subtraction in AA
    - QA/QC - two volounteers - real-time based on nightly hyperloop tasks (JE not yet in the daily) - during the run(!) - possibly intensive when data being collected (issue: timing of the reporting - 6:30AM? - daily [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330828/) )
- Raymond asked for minutes of the JE o2 meeting - listed up.

## Re trigger threshold for the software trigger
- response from Filip - look into the slides in detail
- bias studies for R=0.6
