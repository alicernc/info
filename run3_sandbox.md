# Runs for Run 3 analysis testing
Links I found useful to figure out run status
1. Figure out what period a run belongs to <https://alimonitor.cern.ch/hyperloop/runlists>
2. Spreadsheet(!!) for QA status in Pb-Pb <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vsl-pkLdUoNXZm6muPyMENWdDSKM7UDtQLcXc2B9QhE/edit#gid=492527515>

## Potentially interesting runs Pb-Pb:
- LHC23zzh_cpass1 - Run 544116 - TPC GOOD - ITS GOOD , but EMC not participating. Also run only 7 min long
- LHC23zzh_cpass1 - Run 544126 - same as above but EMCal also not participating
- **FJ suggestion:** LHC23zzk_cpass0      - Run 544451, roughly 30min run. Looking at QA it looks like TPC, ITS and EMCal have status good! Roughly 29khz interaction rate and 45mio inelastic events
