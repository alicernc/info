# Runs for Run 3 analysis testing
Links I found useful to figure out run status
1. Figure out what period a run belongs to <https://alimonitor.cern.ch/hyperloop/runlists>
2. Spreadsheet(!!) for QA status in Pb-Pb <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vsl-pkLdUoNXZm6muPyMENWdDSKM7UDtQLcXc2B9QhE/edit#gid=492527515>

Potentially interesting runs:
LHC23zzh_cpass1 - Run 544116 - TPC GOOD - ITS GOOD , but EMC not participating. Also run only 7 min long
