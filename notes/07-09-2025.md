- skimmed trees - conversion macro to "Berkeley/FJ" trees - https://github.com/KirillVNaumov/AO2DToBerkeleyTreeConverter/blob/master/src/Converter.cpp  (git - https://github.com/KirillVNaumov/AO2DToBerkeleyTreeConverter.git )

- analyses targets
  - inclusive EED and EEC in dijets - Houston (Ibrahim, Wenqing)
  - photon-jet EECs in pp; “charged” EEC’s in PbPb - Tucker (unclear if Run 3)
  - Subjets - pp and PbPb + other cooking - e.g. mixed events (Luisa, Rita and Mateusz)
  - …

- cross-section normalization not available (pp data) - work in progress - in two weeks?

- pp at reference energy - JE derived data needs to be produced - need to define the request (including triggers - perhaps including new software triggers)

- request for PbPb derived data - need to be defined (what in the skim / stats etc)

- gamma-jet MC not yet requested

- QA - action items
  - Ibrahim showed QA with a high-pT issue in a region of phi; however, conclusions need to wait for more detailed analysis
  - make sure the event selection (e.g, bit sel8 for 22o) and the track selection applied
  ```
  enum JTrackSel {
    trackSign = 0, // warning : this number is hardcoded in the sign coloumn in the JTracks table so should not be changed without changing it there too
    globalTrack = 1, // good for Run 3
    qualityTrack = 2,
    hybridTrack = 3,
    uniformTrack = 4,
    uniformTrackWoDCA = 5
  };
  ```
  - need to confirm the skim consistent 1:1 with the original (pre-Berkeley-skim) data

- MC status?
  - Jet-jet MC’s complicated - reasonable handle but stalled on the final QA - pass7 anchored; 
  - 2023 PbPb anchored - ready;
  - QA is on PWG-JE — 22o finished; 23 PbPb to be done
